My cats can’t see a thing but they sure chased after the squirrel on it like it was dancing in front of their noses.</p><p>“It was a nice rug and they were surely going to ruin it, so I gave it to my cousin, who was moving into a new place that had wood floors.</p><p>“She refused to buy a new rug for herself–she said they were way too expensive. She’s always been very frugal, and she clips every coupon and shops every sale at Noah’s Market.
In fact I like to tease her that Noah actually loses money whenever she comes in the store.</p><p>“I think she’s been taking it too far lately though. Once the subway fare increased, she stopped coming to visit me. And she’s really slow to respond to my texts. I hope she remembers to invite me to the family reunion next year.”</p><p>Can you find her cousin’s phone number?</p><form class="answer" id="answer6"><input type="hidden" id="qnum" value="p6">
