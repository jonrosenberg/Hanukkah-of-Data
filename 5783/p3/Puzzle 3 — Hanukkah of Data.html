They called up the cleaning contractor straight away and asked about the rug.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, I did some special projects for them a few years ago.
I remember that rug unfortunately.
I managed to clean one section, which revealed a giant spider that startled me whenever I tried to work on it.</p><p>“I already had a fear of spiders before this, but this spider was so realistic that I had a hard time making any more progress.
I kept expecting the cleaners would call for the rug, but they never did.
I felt so bad about it, I couldn’t face them, and of course they never gave me another project.</p><p>“At last I couldn’t deal with the rug taking up my whole bathtub, so I gave it to this guy who lived in my neighborhood.
He said that he was naturally assertive because he was a Aries born in the year of the Dog, so maybe he was able to clean it.</p><p>“I don’t remember his name.
Last time I saw him, he was leaving the subway and carrying a bag from Noah’s.
I swore I saw a spider on his hat.”</p><p>Can you find the phone number of the person that the contractor gave the rug to?</p><form class="answer" id="answer3"><input type="hidden" id="qnum" value="p3">
