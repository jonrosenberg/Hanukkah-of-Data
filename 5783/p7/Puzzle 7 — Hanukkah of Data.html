I’ll tell you what happened to it.</p><p>“One day, I was at Noah’s Market, and I was just about to leave when someone behind me said ‘Miss! You dropped something!’</p><p>“Well I turned around and sure enough this cute guy was holding something I had bought.
He said ‘I got almost exactly the same thing!’
We laughed about it and wound up swapping items because he had wanted the color I got.
We had a moment when our eyes met and my heart stopped for a second.
I asked him to get some food with me and we spent the rest of the day together.</p><p>“Before long I moved into his place.
It didn’t last long though, as I soon discovered this man was not the gentleman I thought he was.
I moved out only a few months later, late at night and in quite a hurry.</p><p>“I realized the next day that I’d left that tapestry hanging on his wall.
But the tapestry had come to represent our relationship, and I wanted nothing more to do with him, so I let it go.
For all I know, he still has it.”</p><p>Can you figure out her ex-boyfriend’s phone number?</p><form class="answer" id="answer7"><input type="hidden" id="qnum" value="p7">
